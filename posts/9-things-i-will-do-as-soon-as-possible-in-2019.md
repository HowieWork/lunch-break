2019, Happy New Year! Ro found that many people in the circle of friends summed up the past 2018 and set up the New Year Flag. Ro also took advantage of the heat to sort out the nine things that affected him the most in the past year. These nine things are an explanation for 2018 and an expectation for 2019:

## 1. Record your thoughts at any time

Technology has given us more tools to record our thoughts at any time. If you don't consciously record, you'll forget quickly; if you've been consciously just simply remembering ideas, this will always occupy the brain's resources. Therefore, you need to develop the habit of recording your thoughts at any time. After a long period of accumulation, you will find that this is a precious treasure. Hardly, you will find in it that an idea can become a reality.

## 2. Improve your language skills

I believe everyone knows the benefits of "learning another language and opening a new world". What Ro proposes here is that, neurologically, learning a new language allows your brain to generate more neural connections. Ro's personal experience is that last year, I studied Spanish intensively for a trip to Mexico. During that time, my mind's thoughts/reactions were very fast, and the way of thinking about problems also changed.

## 3. Build a personal website/public account/blog

Create a space, write some text regularly, and organize your thoughts. The advantages of this are: create opportunities for more people to hear your voice; if it is about new skills, you can re-understand the way you learn new skills, and slowly expand into new areas of exploration . After all, the world is more welcoming of diverse talents.

## 4. Study your Role-model

Do you realize that you just knew your Role-model in the past, but never deeply researched everything about him/her/? The Role-model here may be someone who is already very successful in a related field, or someone you simply admire, or someone you want to live the same life in the future. Ro thinks that we can study this person thoroughly, not to imitate, but in the process of in-depth research, learn/master some principles/methods to achieve success, and add some weights on the way to success .

## 5. Maintain a weekly exercise habit

The benefits of exercising three to four times a week are: mentally relieve stress; improve your sleep quality; increase self-discipline, focus, creativity; better achieve [Work-life balance] (work-life balance).

## 6. Organize your personal balance sheet

The balance sheet is the result of subtracting the savings/assets you have now and your credit card (the fees you need to pay). In the process of financial management, you may lose motivation and realize that there are many things you can't buy. Of course, this also leads to the result of rational consumption; on the other hand, through your personal balance sheet, you will have a new perspective on your labor efforts. understanding, generating new impetus.

## 7. Appreciate someone you used to be a little bit out of

Try to appreciate someone you used to be a little bit out of: a loved one, a celebrity or even your co-worker. He/she may be your age, but for some reason, he/she is more successful than you in life. In fact, psychologically speaking, part of your rejection suggests that you are trying to be that kind of person. In fact, the process of blind rejection often takes you away from the direction that originally made you successful/happy. Instead, appreciation can open your heart and pull you back in the right direction.

## 8. Do something scary

Overcome the timidity in your heart and do something you think you are afraid of. For example, at work, take the initiative to put forward your ideas about the project to the supervisor; at regular meetings, put forward your suggestions on the work process; give a public speech; in life, take the initiative to open up to the person you like, but have been afraid to express. . In this way, slowly overcome the fear in your heart and eliminate the discomfort, you will find that "very afraid" will become "not afraid" or even "like it".

## 9. Tell your parents, I love you

Even your parents, or people close to you, will be somewhat alienated from you. Take the opportunity, summon up your courage, and say to them, I love you, which can bring your relationship closer.

The above is Roâ€™s summary, and it will also be the nine things to do as soon as possible in 2019. Just like LunchBreak's slogan: "We are a group of interesting people who pursue [Work-life balance]", Ro believes that these nine things will make us constantly break out of our comfort zone and do what we like, Interesting and challenging work, to meet more people who are passionate about work and life, and to cherish everything you have!
