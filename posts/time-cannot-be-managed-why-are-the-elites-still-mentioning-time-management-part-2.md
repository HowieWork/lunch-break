The concept of "time management", in a nutshell, uses strategies and techniques to help people get work done and achieve goals.
In this article, Ro will take you to continue to discuss "time management", we will know the two enemies of "time management" and a solution.

## The Enemy of Time Management: Procrastination [Image]

Procrastination stems from a very powerful physical law: inertia
(Objects tend to stay put, people do the same / keep moving objects moving, repel resistance, beneficiary) [Image]
Procrastination hurts only myself, because no one really cares how my life goes, except myself.
Strategy

1. Put a piece of paper or index card in your pocket;
2. Break down large projects into manageable pieces;
3. Teach your mind (consciousness) to recognize the first signs of laziness or procrastination;
4. Insist on taking notes in a certain way

## The Enemy of Procrastination: The Perseverance [Image]

Resilience is a skill that can be developed. People who develop strong mental strength are more likely to follow a schedule/plan; make the right choices; maintain good focus; and thus beat procrastination.
How to cultivate perseverance?

1. You are not your mind: You can listen to your mind at a higher level, therefore, you can control those negative thoughts in your mind like laziness, procrastination.
2. Like anything else, thought is a tangible object that can be controlled: absorption/expulsion;
3. Your brain can only process one dominant thought at a time, learn to divert your thoughts - turn your thoughts into powerful positive images or thoughts, try to focus on the positive thoughts, and the negative thoughts will be replaced.

## The enemy of time management: clutter [picture]

Clutter causes emotional stress; leads to inaction; reduces productivity

Ro is here to recommend a book "Just Do It: The Art of Stress-Free Work". Written by David Allen, one of America's foremost thinkers in time management and productivity.
The book states: "The short-term memory portion of your consciousness—the one that holds all the incomplete, pending, and disorganized 'stuff'—functions like the memory of a personal computer. The capacity of the memory is limited, there's only so much 'stuff' you can store there and still keep running efficiently. Most people's memory is overloaded. They're always distracted, their attention is always Inability to concentrate due to internal mental overload."

1. Make your work area more attractive and equipped with everything you need for your work. You should allow yourself to enjoy being in your work area. Everything you want and need should be within easy reach and at your fingertips.
2. Create a file system. Having all the material on a particular topic in one place (within a folder) is a huge step towards better time management and organization.
3. Make a choice for each job: 1) take action now; 2) leave it out or give it up; 3) include it in a checklist for further action later.
4. Check your storage and productivity systems weekly: See if your systems are working properly? Are you still feeling overwhelmed by having to remember too many things? and adjust as needed.
5. Review your long-term goals at least once a month. Are you always making the right choices and moving yourself step by step towards your long-term goals? Or are you stagnant? Make sure you are going in the right direction.

## A solution

Know the plan --> Make a task list [picture]

### Recognize the importance of planning

1. Every hour of planning is worth five hours of execution
2. Take at least ten minutes of planning every day: time can be arranged in the morning; night owls can be arranged the night before
   What do I want to accomplish today?
   How much time do I have to do these things?
   Can I do some work that is not important to me and do it at other times?
   Is there a logical order between the work I need to get done? 【picture】
3. Learn to do things in batches: As you plan each day's work, you can group things together at the same time or in the same place or in the same way.
   "Take time to think, but when the time to act comes, stop thinking and start attacking" Napoleon [Picture]

### Make a to-do list

A to-do list is a physical product that reflects all your planning and preparation.
David Allen, "One way to develop a peaceful mind is to build a system of information gathering and processing" [image]
A to-do list is like a system through which you can manage almost everything you need along the way in one place.

Here Ro would like to recommend another book "The Power of Time: A Mature Mechanism That Allows You to Get More Done" by Brian Tracy.
The book points out: "Every effective execution starts with a daily to-do list. It is by far the most powerful tool for increasing productivity I have discovered. When you create a daily to-do list, you start writing about yourself. Every task you want to complete over the course of the day. The rule is: the first day you start using the task list, your productivity will increase by 25%. This means that in every eight hours of work You'll get an extra two hours of work during the day... By using a to-do list, you can get out of the clutter and get organized faster than with other time management tools."

### 3 reasons to make a to-do list

1. Understand how you use your time, think about what to do and what not to do, and have a clear time frame
2. The worry caused by the tasks floating in the mind can be avoided and the same can be guaranteed to be completed
3. Improve your creativity: This process can actually be seen as creating a mini-fiction with you as the protagonist, so that you can play freely, and then sublime your creativity, because you will never know when you are making the list, you What interesting ideas or ideas will pop up.
