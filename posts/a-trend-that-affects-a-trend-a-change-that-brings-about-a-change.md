Summary: Five minutes will take you to watch the New Year's Eve speech of "Friends of Time".

## Background story

The "Friends of Time" New Year's Eve speech was held at 20:30 on December 31, 2018 in Shenzhen.
The founder Luo Zhenyu (hereinafter referred to as: Luo) is determined to hold 20 games, which is the fourth and the seventeenth from the bottom.
The whole speech lasted four hours, and Luo Lian asked five key questions, which hit people's hearts.

Now, with Ro, I will show you the wonderful content of the New Year's Eve speech of "Friends of Time" in five minutes.

## Opener

Luo points out this year's theme: Microtrends

## The main points

1. The word trend is too macro, and it is a bit out of reach for ordinary people.
   When it comes to trends, we think of artificial intelligence, blockchain, etc. These are all major trends, and ordinary people cannot grasp its direction.

2. New term: Small trends are things that happen to most of you and me.
   The impact of small trends is like a domino effect, where small initial changes accumulate to produce large trends. If the big trend is a tsunami, the small trend is like a slightly bigger wave. If you can find it, you can enjoy the progress of the times by standing on it. For example, the birth of the Internet has allowed many traditional stores to open stores on the Internet. Many small stores that grasp this trend have become large-scale stores. In addition, many stores use artificial intelligence and big data to complete the business transformation from purchasing to self-brand, and find greater possibilities.

3. It is not easy to catch the small trend, but the small trend is not the only one.
   It is like a car that enters and leaves the station quickly. Each bus stops for a short time. It is not easy to grasp various small trends. Many people feel that they will no longer have the opportunity if they do not grasp a small trend. In fact, there is no last bus for small trends, and there will always be opportunities. What we have to do is to be ready at any time and hurry up to enrich ourselves.

## Speech Essence

(Picture) "Five Questions to Heart" (5 Questions to Catch Small Trends)

1. Can you see the facts?

Understanding abstract problems is the capacity of human evolution. We all know that to understand a person's ability, we must observe through his performance. but
These abstract data do not all reflect the facts: For example, if a person works in a world-class large company and is surrounded by elites, even if his performance looks average, does this mean his ability is poor?

Therefore, if you want to see the facts, you must cultivate the ability of multiple thinking and learn to restore the problem. For example, to choose a good green tea, we should not just be fooled by the gorgeous pictures on the packaging, but to actually taste it. It's not enough to just taste it, but to really understand what kind of green tea is good. Learning to experience is another important way to tell the truth.

2. Can you perceive non-consensus?

Definition of non-consensus: Doing something different from others. If others don't have a consensus on your behavior understanding, and the market doesn't have a consensus on your innovation, these non-consensus will bring pressure, but that's what makes you a leader.
(Picture) it's a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead -- and to find no one there. -- franklin D. Roosevelt
Roosevelt: It's a terrible thing to look back and have no one behind you with all your heart set on leading people forward.
It is precisely because you walk on a path that no one has traveled that someone will follow you later, and you will become a leader.
Non-consensus does not need to be a new consensus. Non-consensus may originate from old consensus and evolve from its development. Just like old things are packaged in new ones, it makes people feel different. For example, many remakes of films may not be accepted by the public at first, but later they are gradually liked by the public because of new forms of expression or different values. Therefore, in the face of the newly born industry, we should not blindly resist, but reflect on whether we sometimes think too shallowly.

3. Do you have enough time?
   Lack of time is a headache for many people. And Luo's point of view is: the problem of time is not not enough, but too long. As anti-cancer drugs continue to be invented, cancer is becoming a new chronic disease, which is still fatal, but it will be more and more later. And once people live longer, the way they look at problems will change qualitatively. The speech mentioned that once people become long-lived, they will face five challenges: (picture)
1. Days after retirement;
1. How to get along with the next generation;
1. How to redefine marriage? Marriage is no longer the first thing a person does when he is an adult, but something he will only think about after taking care of his life;
1. How will the occupation change? A job ten years from now will certainly not be defined by the present. And as humans live longer, jobs change faster. However, because of the longer time, we have more opportunities to learn more skills and develop more interests;
1. How to deal with setbacks? Society generally believes that youth is the capital of mistakes. And as lifespan increases, the number that defines youth becomes larger. The ancients could fail once and end, and we have more chances to fail again.
   (Picture) Luo: All things that can travel through time should be adhered to. All will be filtered by time, and the chapter will be flipped.

1. Where does your strength come from?
   Luo proposed: With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, the real emotions between people will become more precious. He proposed a key word: credit flywheel. The credit generated by people will have more and more power.

1. Does time want to be your friend?
   (Picture) Time Black Hole - Time Amplifier
   You want to be friends with time, but does time want to be friends with you? Many people want to do a lot of things, but the problem is that there will be a steady stream of time black holes around them. Once sucked in, it will be gone for a few hours, such as Douyin, Weibo. Behind these programs are algorithms written by thousands of people. It understands psychology better than you and understands what you are attracted to. But in turn, we can take advantage of that and use them to recommend content you should actually watch. For example, if you want to learn knowledge in a new field, you must restrain yourself from watching those entertaining and fun content. Once you can persevere, you can use algorithms to learn a lot of knowledge that you don’t know. The time black hole for others becomes your time amplifier.
   Believe in long-termism: long-term persistence can amplify a tiny signal. Long-termism can turn the ordinary in the eyes of others into a miracle in the eyes of others.

(Picture) Achievement = Core Algorithm x Lots of repetitive actions²
The core algorithm can be interpreted as survivability: natural advantage, problem-solving ability.
The key to this formula is a lot of repetition. Because it's a squared effect, it means you have to keep doing it and do it for a long time to achieve long-term compounding. In this way, time can truly be your friend.

## Concluding remarks

(Picture) Luo: If I can't catch up, I will prepare and wait for it in the future.
Summary: Everyone has a chance, let's be ready at all times.
