The work status of "working from home" is not enviable. What is really enviable is the state of "working from home and being efficient". In this issue, Ro teaches you how to create a small office environment at home.

## Part One

Ro would like to share two hot words with you:

[SOHO] is the abbreviation of "Small Office, Home Office" (small office, home office). A survey on office fashion trends in 2018 showed that in China, SOHO office accounts for 34.9%.

From this data, we can find that the traditional way of working is changing towards personalization, with more emphasis on personal characteristics and freedom.

[Resi-mercial], a new word to describe the introduction of warm home style into office space, derived from Residential (related to residence) and Commercial (commercial).

To explain in a simple way: At present, many office workers are running around the three-point line: working in the company, working from home, and working in a coffee shop. And Resi-mercial is the integration of these three points, and the design of Resi-mercial style is a design that combines the three. The co-working environment created by WeWork, which is now in the limelight, fits the definition of Resi-mercial style.

## Part Two

The group is slowly expanding with the emergence of a large number of young and ambitious young people, more and more freelancers, and working from home is the way most people work. In order to pursue diversification, many companies accept the way that employees work from home (working from home), and the way to work in the cubicle of the office building every day is no longer the only option.

Even if you still need to work in an office building every day, "working from home" may be the working state you have always dreamed of: you can spend your time freely, stay away from the too serious office environment, or make a cup of coffee, play soft music, and relax Diwo was typing on the keyboard on the sofa chair, and then let the time flow, overflowing with sleepiness...

## Part Three

Wait, what about work?

It seems that the family environment that is too loose and free is not suitable, and the too serious and rigid. Timothy D. Golden (Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA) published in the Journal of Business and Psychology, "Because home workers have no commute buffer, and the office environment overlaps with the living environment, It is often easily torn down physically and mentally by work-family conflict.”

Ro will talk to you about how to create a suitable home office environment.

1. the top priority, choose the right office chair

According to a survey of office interior design by Gensler (American architectural design firm), 91% of workers value their office chairs the most.

For desk chairs/other equipment, there are a few things we need to consider from an ergonomic standpoint: monitor, placement of keyboard tray, lighting options on the desk.

2. Lighting

Introducing natural light into your home office environment can be beneficial for your body and mind, if you can. Even without natural light, creating a good light environment is essential for working from home: light helps us avoid dry eyes and moderately improves the mood at work. For computer workers, you can choose a desk lamp with soft light to illuminate the work surface; for desk workers, the type of task lighting (incandescent, fluorescent) is ideal.

3. Please don’t be cluttered

A scientific study has shown that people with messy desks are actually smart. However, the result of a cluttered environment is increased stress, negative energy and low productivity due to inefficiencies. Ro also recommends that you take a little thought to keep your office environment tidy.

In addition to cleverly using some storage tools (mugs as pen holders, paper clips to summarize documents, etc.), we can organize a set of plans for our own induction, and try to digitize all documents as much as possible to rationally release physical office space.

4. Put the required office resources at your fingertips

While getting up is healthy for long-term desk work, it has the potential to disrupt our work flow, especially complex tasks that require our focus/energy. Ro recommends placing storage closer to the desk for easy access to personal office resources.

5. Adopt some designs that inspire/inspire you

Choose a color you like for your home office environment. Surround yourself with pictures on the wall, posters, inspirational quotes, drawing boards and other things that bring you joy.

6. Don’t forget green plants

Adding green plants to the office environment not only highlights the awareness of green, but more importantly, helps us reduce stress and relieve emotions during work and rest breaks.
