Work-life balance has gradually become a concept advocated by everyone. The behavior guided by the idea is closely related to the space environment we are in. So, how to create a habitat living environment? Which style is right for you?

Through communication with clients, Ro found that many people lacked understanding of interior design, and lacked the relevant vocabulary to describe and define the ideal design style in mind. Here are 12 of the most popular interior designs right now, according to Ro:

## 1. Modern style

Modern style is a relatively broad design style, with clean and clear lines, a single color system, and usually used materials such as metal and glass. Every detail of the modern style reveals a sense of simplicity. Surrounded by a contemporary design, you'll feel smooth, seamless, with no superfluous parts -- just right, just right.

## 2. Contemporary style

Contemporary style emphasizes the present moment, which is different from modern style. Modern, in the twentieth century, began to strictly interpret design styles. Contemporary is more flexible than contemporary: aesthetic curves tend to appear in contemporary design styles. Of course, contemporary and modern are often used interchangeably.

## 3. Minimalism

Minimalism is very popular in western countries. It takes contemporary design elements and simplifies them even further. Minimalism tends to use neutral, single, airy tones; choose simple, linear furniture. There is no sense of redundancy in the overall decoration, and Ro thinks that the minimalist style reveals a bit of asceticism (asceticism). In short, clear and concise lines and functionality are the characteristics pursued by minimalism.

## 4. Industrial style

As the name suggests, industrial style is inspired by industrial architecture: abandoned factories, attics or warehouses in cities. Exposed red brick, wood and plumbing are common in industrial design. It emphasizes the essence of the material, the unfinishedness. High ceilings, walls made of old wood and metal lamps, scattered furniture, you can feel the original charm of industrial materials. If it still feels monotonous, adding an abstract artwork or two or photography can add some bright color to the overall neutral tone.

## 5. Mid-Century Modern

Mid-Century Modern harks back to the design style of the 1950s and 1960s â€“ retro nostalgia. Its design theme is functionality, with an emphasis on simplified, organic forms (such as the "egg-shaped" chair), easy-to-use contemporary and clean craftsmanship. It complements interior trim and also enables a seamless transition from interior to exterior.

## 6. Nordic style

The Nordic style design reveals the simplicity and sophistication of life in Nordic countries. Although the furniture style is simple and low-key, it gives people the enjoyment of art. The furniture will also show some interesting lines while realizing its function, which will bring a sculptural effect.
Scandinavian style features an all-white base and embraces natural elements such as pressed wood, bright plastic, enameled aluminum, steel, and wide planks. Bright colors in simple shades come from artworks, natural fibers, furs or furniture. How to use natural lighting and spacious space is an important design link of Nordic style.

## 7. French country style

Warm and earthy colors are a feature of French country style. Pair it with period wooden furniture for a warm farmhouse feel.
French country style is good at using soft warm tones - red, yellow or gold and natural materials such as stone and brick. The matching furniture includes ornate china tableware, slightly heavier linens and bedspreads.

## 8. Bohemian

Boho is a trendy style in home design and fashion. It reflects a carefree lifestyle: simple rules, always follow your heart. The matching furniture includes traditional lamps, popular textiles and rugs, the owner's collection and a variety of wild symbols.
Floor pillows and comfortable seating space are important elements of the boho style. This eclectic style can be paired with ultra-glamorous chandeliers, a well-worn rug, and mid-century-inspired chairs. There's a laissez-faire attitude in bohemian design: as long as you like it, anything will happen.

## 9. Country style

Rustic design inspired by nature: raw wood and stone.
The rustic design can be incorporated into the decor of the outdoors. Design and architectural details reflect warmth: vaulted ceilings decorated with wooden beams, eco-friendly wooden floors, etc. Country-inspired designs that are in vogue these days often combine rustic designs with modern furniture and accessories.

## 10. Coastal wind

Coastal winds, also known as Hamptons winds, originate from the iconic seaside regions of the United States. Its features include light, airy shades, neutrals leaning towards cool tones, paired with blues and greens. Furniture is usually white or beige. Wood elements are included in the room, and the decorations are often inspired by the ocean. Plaid pillows, large windows, plush sofa in white, and wood painted with blue and white stripes are a classic combination.
The purpose of the coastal wind is to create a relaxed and comfortable environment inspired by the ocean and the sand.

## 11. Traditional style

The traditional style has classic details, ornate furniture and rich decorations. It comes from a keen observation of Eastern and Western cultures. Traditional styles often feature dark woods, rich tones, and a variety of textures and curves. The furniture features exquisite ornate details and uses expensive fabrics such as velvet, silk and brocade. Of course, this includes a variety of patterns and textures. Traditional design has a certain cultural depth and rich layers.

## 12. Transition wind

The transitional style is a very popular style because it draws on both traditional and modern designs, effectively making up for the shortcomings of both. The sense of balance pursued by the transitional style is also an important reason for its popularity.
Transition winds take modern materials like steel and glass and then combine them with luxury furniture. The transitional style uses relatively neutral tones to create a calm, relaxed space that is stylish and welcoming.
