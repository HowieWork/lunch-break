What Ro shares with you is "Rich Habits (Rich Habits)" by Thomas Corley. The book is very short, just over a hundred pages. Its formation process comes from Corley's interviews with many successful people. In many interviews, he found clear differences in the behavior/attitudes of this group. In response to the differences, he developed a program to help people redesign themselves. This program is designed to help them tap into greater success.

The story of how the project was born is what this book begins with, and with each story, Corley tries to instill in the reader the habits of these successful people that are the essence of this book. Below, Ro shares the seven habits described in the book:

1. Read, read, read a lot!

2. Learn to manage wealth and insist on saving 10% of the monthly salary.

3. Insist on regular exercise every week and always pay attention to your health.

4. Set daily goals, remember that all successful people are Goal-oriented (around a clear goal).

5. Deal with people who have the same goals, build a positive social circle, and stay away from people, things, and things that will consume you.

6. Learn [Work-life Balance] (work-life balance), work, entertainment and family are all important for maintaining physical and mental health.

7. Learn to control your thoughts and emotions.

Ro thinks the habits mentioned in the book are basic and easy to understand, and the key is whether you have the determination to do them. In fact, there are many books on how to obtain wealth. The uniqueness of this book is that it is easy to understand, and there are no obscure concepts in the process of reading. The stories told will help you to integrate and deepen the understanding and practical application of habits. Finally, end this article with a slogan from the book:
