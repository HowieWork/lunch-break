New year, new atmosphere! After reading several LunchBreak articles on home design\*, you may be seriously considering redecorating your home for the new year. Then, the decoration of the living room is probably the biggest problem you face. The living room not only covers a large area, but its style basically determines the quality of life and artistic taste of the owner.

The living room, also called the living room in some places, is generally defined as the public part of the home space. This means that its functions should not only meet the requirements of getting along with many people, but also have multiple functions (guest reception, entertainment, leisure, reading, catering, etc.) as a whole. Therefore, the functional design of the living room emphasizes reasonable "concentration" in the case of limited area: you can place the functions you need most in the first position/center position, and then rationally coordinate other functions and divide the area to achieve the overall living room layout. Comfortable and reasonable.

Below, Ro's six guides are to help you analyze the knowledge of living room decoration. let's start!

## Guide One: Learn How to Arrange Furniture

The first question many people face is how to arrange the living room furniture. Simply placing the sofa against the wall and adding a few sofa chairs is not the answer. We need to realize that the cause of the problem is the lack of basis for placing furniture. In fact, this requires planning thinking:

1. From a visual point of view, should we consider which/which furniture is the first thing we expect visitors to see? So should it be arranged in the center, or the most eye-catching place?

2. Starting from the space experience, when there are visitors, what is the communication space we hope to build in our minds? What kind of living room atmosphere can better promote communication? Face-to-face long knee-length talks, or rely on casual communication on the sofa? These spatial experience details can completely guide how we place the furniture in the living room, and are also the key point to achieve the individual characteristics of the living room design;

3. Starting from the traffic flow line, the flow line here refers to how we go from one end of the living room to the other end, which can be divided into two types: direct or indirect/scattered. The direct streamline emphasizes the purpose; while the indirect emphasizes the experience of the space. The idea of ​​streamline can well connect the various functional areas of the living room to achieve the unity of function and form.

## Guide 2: Picking the Right Rug

Carpets are a hassle and challenge in living room design. Properly used, the carpet can not only delineate the specific space of the living room, but also show the owner's character and taste. The most important consideration when choosing a rug is the size of the rug: when the rug is too small, it will make the whole living room look disjointed, unatmospheric and out of place; ideally, there should be about 30-60cm between the edge of the rug and the wall of the room floor.

## Guide 3: Make your walls full of art

A blank wall appears to be an incomplete space, but Ro is not asking everyone to try to fill every inch of the wall. Instead, he suggests embellishing the wall of the living room through art. This is the easiest and most direct way to create a personal living room space. Ro believes that everyone's artistic aesthetic is different, and the most sensible approach is to make your living room appear what you like. Design according to your own intuition, but it is necessary to understand the basic rules of hanging items and how to arrange them.

## Guide Four: Light Up Your Living Room

Lighting is an important and complex element in any room. Compared with the practicality of the kitchen, lighting plays more role in creating space in the living room, but there are still some considerations that cannot be ignored.

For the type of lighting, we can choose:

1. Ambient lighting: Provide comfortable and not dazzling basic lighting for the entire area, usually using indirect lighting or light sources with lampshades;
2. Operational lighting: Provide the required lighting for entertainment, which must eliminate glare and shadows, and provide sufficient brightness to prevent eye fatigue;
3. Accent lighting: lighting that creates visual focus, such as artworks, green plants, etc., usually use track lights or recessed lights.

In addition to understanding the type of lighting, we need to consider placing light sources at different heights throughout the living room. Here Ro recommends considering pendant or recessed lighting, placing floor lamps next to the table.

## Guideline 5: Enhance Color/Tone Sensitivity

In terms of color/tone, you can first use gray to set the tone of the overall space. The gray here comes from the living room floor, walls, and even specific furniture. Then brighten the living room space by adding light or other bright colors to increase the contrast.

And the dominant color is related to our personal inclination for design style\*. After identifying a certain design style, we can enhance the sensitivity of color/tone by recognizing a large number of cases. In this link, Ro recommends that everyone communicate with a good designer. This is the most professional and fastest way.

## Guide 6: Develop a sense of personal scale

The sense of scale is the awareness of the proportional relationship between the overall or local components of a building and people or objects familiar to people. A sense of scale plays a vital role in the entire home design.

Whether it's rugs, furniture or windows in the living room, you should establish a sense of scale in your personal perception, that is, knowing the ideal size and the space in which to place the furniture. Of course, no one can remember everything, and no rules are set in stone. Therefore, cultivating a sense of scale that makes you feel comfortable and conforms to your personal living habits is what Ro recommends.

The above are the six major guidelines for living room decoration. You can regard each guide as an angle for solving decoration problems, or as an evaluation standard. In short, Ro expects that everyone can regard living room decoration as an interesting logical problem. How to have logic Weaving/telling the story of your space is the process of how to design.
