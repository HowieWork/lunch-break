The transitional space between the entrance of the building and the living room is called the entrance. In the traditional concept of home furnishing, the entrance often has the meaning of "hiding". How to "hide"? How to "hide" cleverly? In fact, this seemingly inconspicuous place can often show the owner's taste and wisdom, paving the way for the overall home design style.

In this article, Ro will start from the perspective of "Ending User Experience", and use the reverse way of thinking to take you to find the haute couture design that shows your taste and publicizes your personality.

For the entrance, we can imagine how to use this transition space on weekdays:

The above analysis diagram analyzes a series of behaviors we pass through the entrance from the perspective of the end user experience. Then, with these end-user actions, we can generate the required design elements:

## green plants

Arranging green plants that can be touched everywhere can be a good way to feel good and improve the quality.

## light

A simple desk lamp can be convenient for workers who come home at night without disturbing others.

## storage space

Proper storage space is necessary. Especially on rainy days, add a shelf and tray for umbrellas -- thoughtful and practical.

## Simple soft seat

Ro felt that every porch design should be equipped with a place to sit, which is full of practicality. The seat and storage can make full use of the space.

## Coat hanger

The addition of hangers at the entrance can solve the problem of temporarily placing coats, and at the same time, guests at home can also conveniently place coats for guests.

The "Ending User Experience" mindset introduced by Ro can be extended to other areas of design, such as multifunctional living rooms and all-in-one home offices. In this way, everyone can deeply understand their needs in the early stage, and predict their behavior in the "imaginary space" in advance, so as to avoid the result that the design space is "beautiful but not practical".

In fact, Ro thinks that a good designer should play a role that assists you:

1. Contribute ideas: Use design methods you have not thought of to help you explore the possibility of lifestyle;
2. Provide professional guidance and advice: guide you in a direction that is practical and in line with your own needs;
3. Save time and control funds: help you formulate project engineering time, control costs as much as possible, and avoid detours.

"The porch is small, but the wisdom is big." Are you suddenly enlightened and feel that you can change your porch in minutes, or do you still feel that you need more design ideas to improve your porch space? If you have any ideas or questions, welcome to Ro message.
