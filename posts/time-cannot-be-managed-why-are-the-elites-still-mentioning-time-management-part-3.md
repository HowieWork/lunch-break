Abstract: This is the last part of the "Time Management" trilogy. Ro will explain two core concepts: PRIORITIZING and STREAMING.

(Word count: 1987 / Suggested reading length: 4’30”)

The "Time Management" trilogy will soon see its final installment. In this article, Ro will recognize and master two core concepts with you:

PRIORITIZING
&
Improve efficiency (STREAMING)

PRIORITIZING [Picture]

Stephen Covey's "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" states: "Success isn't an accident, it's about consistently doing the things that are most likely to bring you the results you want."
"Successful people increase their odds of achieving the goals they want to achieve by developing positive lifestyles and habits, or by creating behavioral patterns that help produce good results."

Covey argues that too many people prioritize based on responses—doing the things that are imminent—as opposed to prioritizing them based on initiative—doing the things that matter.
Covey makes his point with quadrants: When making a to-do list, assign each task to one of the following four quadrants:

1. Important but urgent; 2) Urgent but not important; 3) Important but not urgent; 4) Neither urgent nor important [picture]

Here, please take five seconds to think carefully about a question: When these four types of things appear in front of you at the same time, in what order will you complete the work in the different quadrants?

The answer given by Covey is:

Quadrant 1) - Quadrant 3) - Quadrant 2) - Quadrant 4) [Picture]

His explanation of the answer:

1. To make a to-do list, we always need to strike a balance between urgent items and important items, and when possible, put the important before the urgent;
2. Successful time management is about being proactive rather than reactive, habitually reacting in the morning: dealing with emails, voice messages, and questions that pop up overnight. Instead, we should become proactive. Address the action steps that move us forward and bring us closer to our ideals and goals.

Speaking of which, Ro recommends the book How to Manage Your Time and Your Life, author Alan Larkin recommends:
"At the beginning of each day, you think about the items you need to complete and grade each item on an A, B, C. Then, when the day begins, you first go through the A-level items, then the B-level items. A-level items, then C-level items. Sometimes, you may not be able to take B-level and C-level items into consideration, and A-level items are closer to your goals.”
In addition, the book emphasizes: "You must determine the priorities to be done. Please try to avoid the following two practices: low effectiveness, most of the tasks to be done are C items; tasks are done in order from the first item down, and no attention is paid to them. important project."

Ro insisted on following the method in the book (see the picture below), and practiced making his own To-do-list (task plan). The fact is that this method does help you complete more important tasks. Sometimes, C-level projects are often not necessary at the end, and thus save a lot of time.

STREAMING [Picture]

The concept of STREAMING is easy to understand: by doing less work to get more done, the best way to accomplish a goal is to focus on that goal until it's done. And, only then, do you start moving toward your next goal.

Leo Babauta said in The Power of Less: "There has never been a time like today when we are faced with so much information and tasks, with mountains of emails and materials to read. , the need to deal with the pressures of life's incredible demands. I'm a firm believer in simplicity... Achieve more by doing less, not more, because what I do Reduction can be boiled down to two steps: 1, identify points; 2, exclude others. All energy and attention is focused on one challenge, one goal at a time, rather than trying to accomplish everything”

"Sometimes, when we want to do too much, we may accomplish less than we usually do." "The Power of Less" [picture]

"productive" vs "busy"

Tim Ferries on The Four Hour Work Week: "Too many people confuse the difference between having a lot of work to do and doing things that bring you closer to your goals (effects) ."【picture】

Please recognize the difference between busyness and efficiency: busy people may maintain their busyness at the expense of effectiveness. Clarifying your goals is all about being productive and getting closer to your goals.

80% of your achievements come from 20% of your actions. Twenty-eight rule [picture]

The crux of the matter: How to know exactly which of your actions and efforts are the critical 20% that lead to your massive success.

How to apply: Identify your goal --> In order to reach your goal, list five things you are doing --> Which of the five things is most likely to help you reach your goal --> Invest the most energy and attention

Learn to focus and remove distractions

For distractions: 1, stay away from the internet; 2, turn off your phone; 3, turn off all email alerts; 4, unplug the TV; 5, move all electronics (and video games) out of the work area. 【picture】

For distractors: 1. If possible, keep the door closed while working; 2. If not possible and there are other people around: 1) Wear a baseball cap with the visor pulled down to appear unfriendly; 2) Avoid making eye contact with people passing by; 3) Wear headphones (even if nothing is playing); 4) Keep a box of tissues close to you and crumple a few of them to show you have a cold; 5) Any other "personal means" that you find effective. 【picture】

The "Time Management" trilogy has come to an end, but Ro's exploration of scientific "time management" will continue. Hope everyone in the LunchBreak community can manage their time well and enjoy the fun of using time scientifically!
