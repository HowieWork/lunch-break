## Context

The first article\* (an introduction to home interior design) kicks off LunchBreak's exploration of home design. With the theme of "design x home", Ro will continue to share with you the popular and innovative design ideas.

In this issue, Ro will talk about a seemingly inconspicuous home space - the balcony. First a few questions: For most families, is the balcony just a place for washing and drying clothes? Or is the balcony just a place to store things?

According to the professional dictionary, a balcony is a platform that protrudes from the outer wall of a building and is supported by columns or brackets. Railings are built along its edges to prevent objects and people from falling out of the platform. It is an extension of the building. "Extension of the building" abstracts the definition of balcony space very well. Nowadays, many families choose the blurred boundary between the balcony and the living room space (that is, no partition/sliding door) confirms this definition - the balcony is an extension of the living room space. Specifically how to extend, Ro summarizes the following three directions:

## A place to rest/read

In addition to washing and drying clothes, can the balcony become a warm and comfortable rest area? Balconies are often connected to the living room, so they can be one of the ideal places for guests to come and visit. You can speak freely from the balcony while enjoying the fresh air and the view. Of course, for reading lovers, the balcony can be an ideal reading area. With the right atmosphere, the reading experience on the balcony can be very pleasant. If your balcony is in a claustrophobic environment, you may have an opportunity to get in touch with nature: hear the wind through the woods.

- It is a very suitable choice to put lounge chairs on the balcony
- Use a few chairs and a side table to create a comfortable resting nook
- For a more enjoyable and comfortable experience, add pillows and rugs
- Relax on your own balcony and enjoy the view, in Ro's opinion one of the best experiences in the world
- Don't forget to equip your lounge area with everything you need, within easy reach

## A place to eat

Sometimes it's better to have breakfast on the balcony than to sit in the kitchen: First, you can enjoy the fresh air and start your morning on a positive note. Also, if the balcony is in a good location, you can enjoy the view: you can enjoy the view while getting ready for the new day. Turning a balcony into a dining area is actually pretty easy: all you need is a table and two chairs.

- Have some extra chairs for guests who may stay for breakfast
- Try to embellish some colors that cater to the warm atmosphere of the outside world
- If you want to be in a secret garden, try adding green plants or flowers

## A private garden

If you are a nature lover, you can turn your balcony into a private garden. Choosing your favorite plants and pairing them can be a lot of fun. You can even plant trees if you have enough space. In this way, the balcony will become an ideal place for you to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and get close to the beauty of nature.

- If your balcony is equipped with glass doors, you will have a very beautiful view from inside the room
- If you want your balcony decor to be vibrant and fresh, don't forget to use bright/overall colors
- It's also a good idea to choose a wall that allows vegetation to cover the balcony.
- Appropriate plants and flowers can also help you create a refreshing resting environment
- Vertical gardens can be a practical but cool idea for relatively small balconies

By now, you may have a few scenes of a balcony space that fit your personality. Which of the following pictures might be the scene in your imagination? Seems a little complicated? Still don't seem to have a clue?

So, how to dissect these scenes from the designer's point of view, and accurately grasp the most important part of the scene is the skill you need to master slowly. Ro picked the most important seven items from the many scenes.

1. Bar bench + soft and comfortable cushion
2. Small foldable tables and chairs (plastic, wooden)
3. Soft seat with storage function
4. Hanging shelf/side table (do not occupy floor space, maximize space utilization efficiency)
5. Display/storage racks
6. Cushion/Cushion/Bean Bag Chair\*
7. Hammock/Hammock

Rational use and combination of these seven items will create a very functional balcony space without losing personality. Of course, if you have any questions, you can leave a message to Ro at any time. Ro will do her best to answer your questions and offer suggestions that match your personality.
